# ItemCountPlugin
A simple Minecraft plugin that counts how many of a specific item a player has in their inventory when they hold that item. Players can use the `/count` command to see the total count of the item in their inventory, with a cooldown to prevent spam. This plugin is compatible with Minecraft 1.21 and uses Spigot API.
